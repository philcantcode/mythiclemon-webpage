Building an indie game in Unreal Engine? Epic wants to help fund it. Applications for Epic MegaGrants Cycle 1 2026 are now open—and the deadline is closer than you think.

## What is Epic MegaGrants?

Epic MegaGrants is Epic Games' investment program for promising projects built with Unreal Engine. They've already funded over **2,000 grants** to developers worldwide, and they're actively looking for more.

Here's what makes it compelling:

- **Grants range from $5,000 to $150,000** (average $5,000-$75,000)
- **You keep 100% of your IP** - no strings attached
- **Publish however you want** - no exclusivity requirements
- **Open worldwide** - not limited to US developers

This isn't a loan. It's an investment in your project with no repayment required.

## Who's Eligible?

MegaGrants specifically targets smaller teams and solo developers. If you're a AAA studio with massive funding, this isn't for you. But if you're an indie team with a promising project that needs a push to hit the next milestone, you're exactly who they're looking for.

### Eligible Project Types

**Indie Games**  
Small or solo dev teams working on promising games in Unreal Engine. If you need help getting to your next milestone—alpha, beta, vertical slice, or launch—this is your opportunity.

**UEFN Experiences**  
Building the next generation of Fortnite experiences? Whether you're a dev team, established studio, or just have a killer idea, they want to hear about it.

**Engine Switchers**  
Working on a project in another engine but considering Unreal? Epic reserves a portion of grants specifically to help with engine transitions.

**Open Source Tools**  
Creating tools that benefit the Unreal community? Open source projects that enhance the ecosystem are eligible.

## How to Strengthen Your Application

Epic receives thousands of applications. Here's how to stand out:

### 1. Show, Don't Tell

A vertical slice beats a pitch deck. A playable prototype beats concept art. The more you can demonstrate your vision as a working product, the stronger your application.

### 2. Be Specific About Milestones

Don't just say "I need money to finish my game." Define exactly what the grant will accomplish:

- "Fund three months of development to complete the combat system"
- "Cover asset licensing for launch-ready environments"
- "Enable six weeks of polish and bug fixing before Early Access"

### 3. Demonstrate Progress

MegaGrants is designed to get promising projects over the finish line—not fund ideas that haven't started. Show what you've already accomplished with limited resources.

### 4. Have a Clear Vision

What makes your project unique? Why should Epic invest in *this* game over thousands of others? Articulate your creative vision clearly.

## Build Faster, Apply Stronger

Here's the reality: the more polished your demo, the better your chances. But polishing a demo takes time you might not have.

This is where smart tool choices make the difference. Instead of spending weeks on features you could implement in hours, leverage tools that accelerate development:

### Landscape & Terrain

Building an open world? Creating terrain from scratch takes weeks. [Landstamp Pro](product.html?id=landstamp-pro) lets you stamp detailed terrain features in minutes—mountains, valleys, cliffs—with non-destructive editing. Get your world looking impressive fast.

### UI & Documentation

Need in-game tutorials, help screens, or formatted text? [Markdown 4 Blueprints](product.html?id=markdown-4-blueprints) renders markdown directly in UMG widgets. Write documentation once, display it beautifully in-game.

### Task Management

Managing a grant application while developing a game is chaotic. [Easy Kanban Board](product.html?id=easy-kanban-board) keeps your tasks organized without leaving the Unreal Editor. Track features, bugs, and application deadlines in one place.

### Online Features

Adding leaderboards, cloud saves, or analytics? [EasyHTTP](product.html?id=easyhttp) makes HTTP requests from Blueprint with zero C++ required. Connect to REST APIs in minutes, not days.

### Lighting & Stealth

Building a stealth game? [Lumen Meter](product.html?id=lumen-meter) measures actual rendered light levels for visibility systems. No fake light tracing—real lighting detection.

The point isn't just to buy tools. It's to spend your limited time on what makes your game unique, not reinventing solved problems.

## Success Stories

Epic highlights MegaGrant recipients regularly. Here are a few that made it:

**Omno** - A solo developer quit their job to build their dream game. MegaGrants helped make it a critically-acclaimed adventure title.

**Snacko** - A husband and wife duo built a cat-centric farm sim with MegaGrant support, proving two-person teams can create polished, commercially successful games.

**Kibwe** - An animated film produced entirely in Mozambique using Unreal Engine 5—the first UE5 animated film from the country.

These aren't AAA studios. They're small teams with big visions and smart execution.
