# Stop Context Switching: Manage Tasks Without Leaving Unreal Engine

Every time you switch from Unreal Engine to Trello, Jira, Notion, or a spreadsheet, you lose focus. Studies show it takes **23 minutes** to fully regain concentration after a context switch.

For game developers, this adds up fast. Check your task list, lose your train of thought, struggle to remember what you were doing. Repeat dozens of times per day.

What if you never had to leave the editor?

## The Hidden Cost of External Task Tools

### The Context Switch Cycle

A typical developer's workflow:
1. Working on a feature in UE5
2. Need to check what's next → switch to browser
3. Open Trello/Jira/Notion
4. Wait for it to load
5. Find your board
6. Check tasks
7. Switch back to UE5
8. ...where was I?

This happens **10-20 times per day**. At 5 minutes of lost focus per switch, that's **1-2 hours daily** of wasted productivity.

### Tool Overwhelm

External project management tools are designed for entire organizations:
- Complex permission systems you don't need
- Features for departments you don't have
- Learning curves that never end
- Monthly subscriptions that add up

For solo developers and small teams, it's overkill.

### The "I'll Update It Later" Problem

When updating tasks requires leaving your development environment:
- Tasks get marked "done" days after completion
- New tasks pile up in your head instead of the board
- The task list becomes outdated and useless
- You stop using it entirely
