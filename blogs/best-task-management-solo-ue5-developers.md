# The Best Task Management Solution for Solo Unreal Engine Developers

Solo game development is a juggling act. You're the designer, programmer, artist, sound engineer, QA tester, and project manager—all at once.

The last thing you need is complicated project management software designed for 50-person teams. You need something simple, fast, and built for how you actually work.

## The Solo Developer's Task Management Problem

### Too Simple Doesn't Work

Sticky notes, text files, and mental lists seem easy:
- No learning curve
- No setup required
- Completely free

But they fail in practice:
- Sticky notes get lost or ignored
- Text files become disorganized messes  
- Mental lists evaporate under stress
- Nothing shows you the big picture
- Progress isn't visible

### Too Complex Doesn't Work Either

Enterprise tools like Jira, Monday, or Asana offer everything:
- Sprint planning
- Story points
- Burndown charts
- Team permissions
- Integrations galore

But for solo developers:
- 90% of features are irrelevant
- Setup takes hours
- Learning curve is steep
- Monthly subscriptions add up ($10-25/month)
- Constant context switching kills flow

### What Solo Developers Actually Need

The sweet spot is:
- ✅ Visual task board (see everything at a glance)
- ✅ Simple categories (To Do, Doing, Done)
- ✅ Quick task creation (seconds, not minutes)
- ✅ Zero configuration
- ✅ No ongoing costs
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ Integrated with your development environment

This is exactly what **Easy Kanban Board** provides.

## Why Kanban Works for Solo Development

### Visual Progress

Human brains process visual information faster than text. A Kanban board shows:
- What's waiting to be done
- What you're currently working on
- What's finished

This visual overview reduces anxiety ("am I forgetting something?") and increases motivation (look how much is in "Done"!).

### Work-In-Progress Limits

Kanban philosophy: limit how many tasks are "in progress" simultaneously.

For solo developers, this is critical. You can't parallelize yourself. Having 15 tasks "in progress" means 15 tasks getting 7% of your attention each.

Easy Kanban Board's visual layout makes WIP limits obvious. If your "In Progress" column is overflowing, you know to finish something before starting something new.

### Flexibility Without Overhead

Kanban doesn't impose:
- Sprint deadlines
- Story point estimation
- Velocity tracking
- Capacity planning

You move tasks when you work on them, and move them again when you finish. That's it.

## Easy Kanban Board for Solo Developers

### Built for Your Workflow

Easy Kanban Board lives inside Unreal Engine. You don't switch applications to check or update tasks. Your board is always one click away.

**Morning routine:**
1. Open Unreal Engine
2. Glance at Kanban board (already docked)
3. See what's in progress
4. Continue working

No apps to open. No websites to load. No passwords to remember.

### Capture Ideas Instantly

Working on character movement when you think of a level design improvement? Capture it in 3 seconds:

1. Quick-add shortcut (Ctrl+K)
2. Type: "Add destructible crates to warehouse"
3. Enter

Idea captured. Focus maintained. You'll see it in "To Do" when you're ready.

### Track Everything in One Place

Solo developers wear many hats. Your board might include:

```
TO DO:
├── Fix jump animation jitter
├── Create main menu UI
├── Record footstep sounds
├── Write tutorial text
├── Optimize tree LODs
└── Update store screenshots

IN PROGRESS:
├── Player movement refactor

DONE:
├── ✓ Implement save system
├── ✓ Create enemy AI
├── ✓ Design first level
└── ✓ Add particle effects
```

Programming, art, audio, design, marketing—all visible in one view.

### Priority at a Glance

Not all tasks are equal. Easy Kanban Board supports priority levels:

- 🔴 **Critical** - Game-breaking issues
- 🟠 **High** - Important for next milestone  
- 🟡 **Medium** - Should do soon
- 🟢 **Low** - Nice to have

Sort or filter by priority when you need to focus on what matters most.

### Tags for Organization

Use tags to categorize across columns:

- `#bug` - Things that are broken
- `#feature` - New functionality
- `#polish` - Improvements to existing features
- `#art` - Visual assets
- `#audio` - Sound-related
- `#marketing` - Store presence, trailers, etc.

Filter by tag to focus on specific areas.

## Real Solo Developer Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The Game Jam

You have 48 hours. Every minute counts.

**Without Easy Kanban Board:**
- Tasks live in your head
- You forget things under pressure
- Time wasted deciding "what next?"
- No sense of progress

**With Easy Kanban Board:**
- Dump all ideas into "To Do" immediately
- Prioritize ruthlessly
- Always know what's next
- Watch "Done" column grow for motivation

### Scenario 2: The Long-Term Project

You're 6 months into development. Hundreds of tasks completed, hundreds more to go.

**Without Easy Kanban Board:**
- Lost track of what's done
- Can't remember original vision
- Feature creep goes unnoticed
- No milestone visibility

**With Easy Kanban Board:**
- Historical record of all completed work
- New ideas captured in backlog
- Current focus is always clear
- Archive completed tasks by version

### Scenario 3: The After-Work Developer

You have 2 hours after your day job. No time to waste.

**Without Easy Kanban Board:**
- Spend 15 minutes remembering where you left off
- Waste time on low-priority tasks
- End session unsure if you made progress

**With Easy Kanban Board:**
- Open project, glance at "In Progress"
- Immediately know what to continue
- Move task to "Done" with satisfaction
