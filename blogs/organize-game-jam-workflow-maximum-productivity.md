# Organize Your Game Jam Workflow for Maximum Productivity

48 hours. 72 hours. One week. Whatever the timeframe, game jams are pressure cookers where every minute matters.

The difference between finishing a polished entry and submitting a broken prototype often comes down to one thing: **organization**.

## Why Jams Go Wrong

### The "Just Start Coding" Trap

Excitement takes over. You dive into Unreal Engine and start building. No plan, no task list, just pure creation.

**Hours 0-12:** Making progress! Features coming together!

**Hours 12-24:** Wait, what was I supposed to do next? Did I implement saving? What's the core loop again?

**Hours 24-36:** Frantically fixing bugs while remembering features you forgot to build.

**Hours 36-48:** Cutting scope desperately, submitting something barely functional.

Sound familiar?

### The "Overcomplicated Planning" Trap

You've learned from past jams. This time, you'll be organized!

**Hour 0:** Set up Trello board with swimlanes, labels, due dates, and checklists.

**Hour 1:** Still configuring the board. Add a few more labels.

**Hour 2:** Finally start development... but spend 10 minutes updating Trello for every 20 minutes of work.

**Hour 48:** Beautiful Trello board. Mediocre game.

Organization should help, not hurt.

## The Game Jam Sweet Spot

You need:
- ✅ A place to dump all your ideas
- ✅ Clear visibility of what's essential vs. nice-to-have
- ✅ Instant task creation (seconds, not minutes)
- ✅ Zero setup time
- ✅ Progress tracking for motivation

You don't need:
- ❌ Complex project hierarchies
- ❌ Sprint planning
- ❌ Time estimates
- ❌ Multiple boards and workspaces
- ❌ Cloud sync and collaboration features

**Easy Kanban Board** hits this sweet spot perfectly.

## Your Game Jam Kanban Setup

### Before the Jam Starts

Install Easy Kanban Board and have it ready. Zero minutes wasted during the jam itself.

### Hour 0: The Brainstorm Dump (15 minutes)

Theme announced! Ideas flowing! Capture everything in your Kanban board:

```
TO DO:
├── Core movement mechanic
├── Theme interpretation #1
├── Theme interpretation #2
├── Visual style: pixel art
├── Visual style: low poly
├── Sound design approach
├── What platforms?
├── Multiplayer possibility?
└── [10 more half-baked ideas]
```

Don't filter. Don't prioritize. Just dump.

### Hour 0.5: The Ruthless Cut (10 minutes)

Now prioritize. Be brutal.

Move essentials to a "Must Have" column:
```
MUST HAVE:
├── Core gameplay loop
├── Player movement
├── Main mechanic
├── Win/lose condition
├── Basic UI
└── One complete level
```

Move nice-to-haves to "Stretch Goals":
```
STRETCH GOALS:
├── Multiple levels
├── Particle effects
├── Sound design
├── Save system
├── Polish animations
└── Juice and feedback
```

Delete the rest. Seriously. Delete ideas that won't make the cut.

### Hours 1-36: The Build Sprint

Work from "Must Have" only:

1. Pick top task
2. Move to "In Progress"
3. Complete it
4. Move to "Done"
5. Repeat

**Rules:**
- Only ONE task "In Progress" at a time
- Don't touch "Stretch Goals" until "Must Have" is empty
- Bugs go directly into "Must Have" if critical, "Later" if not

### Hours 36-44: Polish Window

"Must Have" should be empty. Now evaluate:
- Is the game submittable? If no, keep on critical fixes.
- Time remaining? Attack "Stretch Goals" by priority.

### Hours 44-48: Lock Down

Stop adding features. Focus only on:
- Game-breaking bugs
- Build and submission prep
- Testing the actual submission

Create a "Submission Checklist" in your board:
```
SUBMISSION:
├── Test on clean machine
├── Create build
├── Write description
├── Take screenshots
├── Upload
└── Submit before deadline!
```

## Jam-Specific Board Configuration

### Recommended Columns

```
| Must Have | In Progress | Testing | Done | Stretch | Cut |
```

- **Must Have**: Essential for submission
- **In Progress**: Currently working on (limit: 1)
- **Testing**: Built, needs verification
- **Done**: Verified working
- **Stretch**: Nice to have if time permits
- **Cut**: Removed from scope (keep for post-jam)

### Quick Tags

- `#critical` - Drop everything
- `#bug` - Something's broken
- `#art` - Visual tasks
- `#audio` - Sound tasks
- `#code` - Programming tasks

### Team Jams

For team jams, add team member names as tags:
- `#alice`
- `#bob`
- `#charlie`

Filter by tag to see your personal queue.

## Psychological Benefits

### The "Done" Column Motivator

Watching tasks accumulate in "Done" provides dopamine hits throughout the jam. This isn't trivial—it fights burnout and maintains momentum.

### Anxiety Reduction

"Am I forgetting something critical?" is a constant jam anxiety. When everything's on the board, your brain can relax and focus on building.

### Decision Fatigue Prevention

"What should I work on next?" wastes mental energy. Your board answers instantly: top of "Must Have," always.

### Scope Creep Resistance

New idea mid-jam? Add it to "Stretch Goals" and forget about it. The board protects you from yourself.

## Post-Jam Value

### Bug List for Patches

Everything in "Known Issues" is your post-jam patch roadmap.

### Cut Features for Full Release

"Cut" column shows what you wanted but couldn't fit. Perfect for continuing development.

### Lessons Learned

Review your board after the jam:
- What was underestimated?
- What was overscoped?
- What workflow improvements for next time?

## Minute-Zero Ready

The best time to set up your jam workflow is **before the jam starts**:

1. Install Easy Kanban Board
2. Create your column structure
3. Add common tags
4. Test that everything works

When the theme drops, you're immediately productive.

## Win Your Next Jam

Organization isn't optional for jam success—it's essential. But it shouldn't steal time from making your game.

Easy Kanban Board gives you just enough structure with zero overhead.
